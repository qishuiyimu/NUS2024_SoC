This repository contains the paper of our project.

In this paper we propose a secure communication scheme for self-driving vehicle Networking. The integration of Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) and blockchain technology presents a groundbreaking approach to addressing the authentication and communication challenges inherent in the realm of self-driving vehicles. This shift towards decentralization not only streamlines the authentication process but also significantly enhances the security and reliability of vehicular communication networks, thereby meeting the dynamic demands of future smart transportation ecosystems.

Within our proposed DPKI framework, the utilization of Distributed Identifiers (DIDs) recorded on a blockchain ensures a decentralized storage of individual vehicle information. This innovative approach empowers entities such as the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) with the capability to record pertinent vehicle details directly onto the blockchain, facilitating efficient identity verification processes.

Furthermore, our design addresses the communication challenges akin to the "two generals problem" in vehicular networks by equipping Roadside Units (RSUs) with advanced functionalities. This strategic enhancement not only optimizes the utilization of road infrastructure in smart cities but also paves the way for seamless and secure vehicular communication, marking a significant advancement towards the realization of efficient and safe autonomous transportation systems.
